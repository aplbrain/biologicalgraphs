## Biologically-Constrained Graphs

The code repository for the 2019 CVPR paper *Biologically-Constrained Graphs for Global Connectomics Reconstruction* [1]. For more information: https://www.rhoana.org/biologicalgraphs.

### Dependencies

This code requires the C++ Graph library from Bjoern Andres: http://www.andres.sc/graph.html [2, 3]. This package should not require additional packages or installation as all functions are included in header files.

### Installation
You can install by creating a docker container with:
```
docker build -t biologicalgraphs .
```


### Meta Files

Each new dataset needs a meta file named meta/{PREFIX}.meta where {PREFIX} is a unique identifier for the dataset. All functions in this repository require as input this {PREFIX} identifier to find the locations for the requisite datasets (i.e., image, affinities, segmentation, etc.). An example meta file is provided in `neuronseg/meta/Kasthuri-test.meta`. This file contains all of the necessary dataset references. 

### Directory Structure

This python package assumes a certain directory structure. Call the parent directory `{PARENT_DIR}`. All input segmentations should reside in `{PARENT_DIR}/segmentations`. All meta files must be saved in `{PARENT_DIR}/meta`. 

### Example Script

There is an example script to run the complete framework in the `neuronseg/scripts` folder. This script runs the entire framework on the testing portion of the Kasthuri dataset [4]. The ground truth for this dataset is in `neuronseg/golds` and our input segmentations are in `neuronseg/segmentations`. The meta file `neuronseg/meta/Kasthuri-test.meta` contains the relevant links and can act as a guide for future datasets. The network architectures used for the results in the paper are included in the subdirectories in `neuronseg/architectures`.
